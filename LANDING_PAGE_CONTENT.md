## FAQ Section

### Headline
Frequently Asked Questions

### Questions & Answers

**Q: How does Vibecon find mutual connections?**

A: After you connect your LinkedIn account, Vibecon syncs your connections and uses LinkedIn's API to find which of your connections know your target prospects. We then score each relationship based on how well they know each other.

---

**Q: Will this spam my LinkedIn network?**

A: No. You approve every message before it sends. Vibecon spaces out requests (max 30/day) and tracks who you've contacted to avoid over-asking. We also blacklist any mutuals who prefer not to be contacted.

---

**Q: Can I customize the messages?**

A: Yes! Configure your company info, writing style guidelines, and tone preferences in Settings. You can also edit any generated message before approving it. The AI learns from your preferences.

---

**Q: What if I don't have many connections?**

A: Vibecon works best with 200+ connections, but you can start with fewer. We find mutuals wherever they exist and maximize your existing network. As you grow your LinkedIn network, Vibecon becomes more effective.

---

**Q: How long until I see results?**

A: Most users get their first intro request approved within 24-48 hours. Mutuals typically respond within 3-5 days. You can track everything in real-time through the dashboard.
